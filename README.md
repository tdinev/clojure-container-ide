# Portable Clojure development environment

## ðŸ’¼ Contents

The `Dockerfile` in this repository allows building an OCI image usable as a portable development environment based on the latest [official Clojure image](https://hub.docker.com/_/clojure).
The produced image contains the following manually added utilities:

* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs)
* [Prelude configuration](https://prelude.emacsredux.com) for Emacs
* Local mirrors of the following package archives for Emacs:
  * [GNU ELPA](https://elpa.gnu.org)
  * [Org mode ELPA](https://orgmode.org)
  * [MELPA](https://melpa.org)

  maintained by [d12frosted](https://github.com/d12frosted/elpa-mirror) and as instructed by [ninrod](https://github.com/ninrod/emacs-antiproxy).

This repository arose from a need to be able to play and experiment with Clojure and functional programming in general in environments that are behind a corporate firewall and thus make downloading artifacts and installing executables difficult or at the very least unpleasant.

The produced image is *by no means minimal* and it is not designed to be.
On the contrary, a handful of development tools deemed useful are installed to make for a more enjoyable developer experience.

## Prerequisites

The only prerequisite is a container platform like [Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [Podman](https://podman.io).

## ðŸ’¡ Usage

The following are instructions for novices.

### Get contents

Clone this repository using Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tdinev/clojure-container-ide.git
```

or download and extract the [ZIP archive](https://github.com/tdinev/clojure-container-ide/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

### Build local image

Build the OCI image:

```bash
docker build -t clojure-ide clojure-container-ide
```

`clojure-ide` denotes the name of the image, its tag is `latest` (since no tag has explicitly been specified), and `clojure-container-ide` is the name of the directory containing the contents of this repository.

This step may take some time (probably up to two minutes) as several packages need to be downloaded.

### Start a container

Spin off a container in interactive mode:

```bash
docker run -it --name clojure-dev clojure-ide
```

The container will be called `clojure-dev`.

### Use the container

You are now in a bash environment.
You can play around with the Clojure REPL:

```bash
clojure
```

(You can exit the REPL by sending the `EOF` character, usually by typing `CTRL+D` or `CTRL+Z`.)

Or you can start a new app using Leiningen:

```bash
lein new app test-app
```

and Emacs as your editor (the first Emacs startup time will be considerable as a number of configurations will be performed).

### Stopping the container

You can exit the container from within by typing

```bash
exit
```

in the shell.

### Resuming the container

If the container is exited, you can resume it to avoid the somewhat long waiting time when creating a new one

```bash
docker container start clojure-dev
docker attach clojure-dev
```
